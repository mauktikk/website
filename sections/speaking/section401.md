**At the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research (NALSAR), India (Video begins at the ~3:10 mark).** 

**Of late, neuroscience has emerged as one of the most intriguing fields of research. In addition to developing new tools to understand the inner workings of the brain, neuroscience has also started posing some tough legal, social and ethical issues related to science. New techniques aimed at “reading” human thoughts to understand what actions they are planning, and directly controlling thoughts and actions, are bringing up philosophical issues about free will, relationships and our belief systems. The lecture also touches upon the philosophy of law and role of public policy in shaping the future of neuroscience.**
