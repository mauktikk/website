**When you backpack solo through unknown parts of the world or countries in which you don't speak the language, you get a lot of food for thought. Having crossed the 50-country mark recently, the hilarious, unforgettable, exhilarating, and occasionally life threatening experiences he has lived through have inspired Mauktik to write books. If you are an adrenalin junkie, travelogue lover, or one of the dying tribe of bibliophiles, check them out. Hard copies and e-books are available on Amazon, Flipkart and a few other online outlets.**
